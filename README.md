# hassio-addons
Just a few things i've been working on

Most of the addon's here have been created out of my own personal need, while i do not officially offer support i'm happy to help with basic issues

All of the AWS based addons will require the AWS-CLI to be installed on the home assistant instance

Happy coding!...
